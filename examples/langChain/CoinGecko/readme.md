## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **400 Bad Request**:
   - Ensure your API key is valid and has access to the required endpoints.
   - Verify that the token addresses are correct.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Add a delay between requests if you encounter rate-limiting errors.

3. **Invalid Token Addresses**:
   - Use valid Solana token addresses (e.g., `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112` for Wrapped SOL).
